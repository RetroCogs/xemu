reCPM defines a "quasi-hardware" interface, thus it's possible to write custom
programs interacting with the emulator directly. Communication is done via
I/O ports.

I/O ports:


00h:	read=status, write=IGNORED

	read=selected disk, write=select disk
	if there is an error, selected disk won't change (check with read back)


Track number low byte
Track number hi byte
Sector number low byte
Sector number hi byte
Sector command = $80 -> read sector, $81 -> write sector
       read: status: $FF = busy
Sector command error register


- resets sector buffer position
- put one byte into the sector buffer
- get one byte from the sector buffer





Write console (character)
Console status
Read console
Set console mode
	00	- do not change console only reset state



Reset console





00h:  read=-, write=write sector
